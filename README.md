IMS
===

Image Management System (Cytomine-IMS) is a web application for images manipulation.
The goal of this server is to carry most of the image operations and to provide a simple REST API with multiple images support. The IMS server provides services to:

* upload an image,
* get image tiles
* get image thumb/preview
* get annotation crop (image roi)
* ...

It uses Grails/Groovy/Java.

## How to install it

It is automatically installed with the [Cytomine-bootstrap](https://github.com/cytomine/Cytomine-bootstrap) procedure using Docker.
